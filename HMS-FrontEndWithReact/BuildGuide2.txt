ADDENDUM TO MASTER INSTRUCTION DOCUMENT
PUBLIC-FACING LANDING WEBSITE & MARKETING PAGES

NOTE: The original Master Instruction Document (Sections 0-23) focused exclusively on the authenticated patient portal. This addendum adds a complete specification for the public-facing landing website that serves as the entry point to the patient portal.

SECTION 24: LANDING WEBSITE OVERVIEW
24.1 Purpose & Scope
The Landing Website Serves To:

Introduce the hospital/clinic system to potential patients
Build trust and credibility
Provide essential information (services, doctors, locations)
Enable patient login access to the portal
Facilitate appointment booking inquiries
Display public health information
Showcase hospital achievements and facilities

The Landing Website is NOT:

A generic hospital template
An overly animated "startup" website
A flashy marketing site with gimmicks
A social media-style platform

The Landing Website IS:

A calm, professional medical information hub
A trust-building first impression
A gateway to the authenticated patient portal
A resource for potential and existing patients


24.2 Relationship to Patient Portal
Two Distinct Applications:

Public Landing Website (this section)

URL: www.hospital.com
Accessible to everyone (no login required)
Built with React (same tech stack)
Can be deployed separately or as part of main app with public routes
Shares design system with patient portal


Authenticated Patient Portal (Sections 0-23)

URL: portal.hospital.com or www.hospital.com/portal
Requires login
Clinic-scoped data access
Previously specified in full detail



Navigation Flow:
Public Website → Login → Clinic Selection → Patient Dashboard
                   ↑
            (CTA buttons throughout public site)

24.3 Technology Continuity
Shared Elements:

React framework
Design system (Serenity in Blue palette)
Typography system
Spacing scale
Component patterns
Accessibility standards

Different Elements:

More visual/illustrative content (hero sections, testimonials, galleries)
SEO optimization critical
Public API endpoints (no auth required)
Static content management


SECTION 25: VISUAL DESIGN SYSTEM FOR LANDING PAGES
25.1 Design Philosophy: "Medical Trust & Warmth"
The landing website must balance:

Professionalism - Medical credibility
Warmth - Human-centered care
Modernity - Current medical standards
Clarity - Easy to understand

Avoid:

Stock photo overload (generic doctor images)
Overly corporate/cold aesthetic
Trendy web design fads (glassmorphism, neumorphism, extreme gradients)
Aggressive animations
Auto-playing videos
Chatbot popups that obscure content
Cookie banners that cover half the screen
"Scroll-jacking" or parallax overuse


25.2 Color System Extension
Primary Palette (Same as Portal):

Primary Blue: #2C5F8D
Secondary Blue: #5B8FB9
Tertiary Blue: #A8C5DA
Background: #F8FAFB
Text: #1A2B3C

Landing Page Accent Colors (NEW):

Warm Accent (for humanity/care): #7A9D9E (Muted teal)

Use for: Testimonials, human stories, care messaging


Highlight Gold (for achievements/trust): #C5A572 (Desaturated gold)

Use for: Awards, certifications, statistics
Use sparingly (less than 5% of page)



Photography/Imagery Overlay:

Dark overlay on hero images: rgba(26, 43, 60, 0.7) (dark blue-black)
Light overlay for bright images: rgba(248, 250, 251, 0.85)


25.3 Typography for Landing Pages
Display Typography (Hero Headlines):

Hero H1: 56px (desktop), 36px (mobile), Weight 700, Line Height 1.1
Hero Subheadline: 24px (desktop), 18px (mobile), Weight 400

Section Headlines:

H2: 40px (desktop), 28px (mobile), Weight 600
H3: 32px (desktop), 24px (mobile), Weight 600

25.4 Spacing & Layout for Landing
Section Padding:

Desktop: 80px vertical, 48px horizontal
Tablet: 60px vertical, 32px horizontal
Mobile: 48px vertical, 20px horizontal

Section Max Width:

Content sections: 1200px
Full-width sections (hero, galleries): 100%

Grid System (12-column):

Same as portal, but more flexible layouts
Asymmetric grids allowed (e.g., 7-5 split for content-image)


25.5 Imagery Guidelines (CRITICAL - Avoid Generic)
Photography Style:

Real Photos Preferred: Actual hospital facilities, real staff (with permission)
Diverse Representation: Age, ethnicity, gender diversity
Natural Lighting: Avoid overly staged or studio-lit photos
Context: Show medical environment naturally (not models in lab coats)

What to AVOID:

Stock photos of models in white coats pointing at tablets
Overly happy/smiling doctors (unrealistic)
Perfect families in waiting rooms (staged)
Generic medical equipment close-ups
Blue-tinted everything

What to USE:

Real hospital corridors, waiting areas (clean, well-lit)
Actual medical equipment in use (appropriately)
Genuine patient-doctor interactions (with consent)
Architectural shots of facilities
Close-ups of caring gestures (hand-holding, reassurance)
Abstract medical patterns (subtle backgrounds)

Illustration Style (if used):

Minimal line art
Medical iconography (anatomical, diagnostic)
Muted colors matching palette
Not cartoonish or playful


25.6 Animation Principles for Landing
Allowed Animations:

Scroll-triggered Fade-ins:

Elements fade in as user scrolls to section
Duration: 400ms
Easing: Ease-out
Offset: Start animation 100px before element in view
NO bounce, NO elastic, NO overshoot


Hover Effects:

Subtle scale (1.02 max)
Color transitions
Border color changes
Duration: 200ms


Parallax (VERY SUBTLE):

Background images move slower than foreground
Max speed differential: 0.5x
Only on hero section


Number Counting Animation:

For statistics (e.g., "500+" counts from 0 to 500)
Duration: 1.5s
Triggered once on scroll into view


Image Zoom on Hover (Galleries):

Image scales to 1.05 within container (overflow hidden)
Duration: 300ms



FORBIDDEN Animations:

Auto-playing carousels
Infinite scrolling animations
Shake/wiggle effects
Typing effects
Confetti/celebrations
3D transforms
Rotate/flip cards (unless user-triggered)

Respect prefers-reduced-motion (same as portal)
